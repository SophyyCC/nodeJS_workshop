# CS Capstone workshops - Node.js, Express

In this workshop, we'll be working mostly in the [_backend_](./backend/) project. **You should open VS Code in the _backend_ folder itself, rather than this one.**

For _step 4_, we'll switch over to the [_frontend_](./frontend/) project (and should open another VS Code window directly in that folder).
